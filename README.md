# WTFIDunno
A bizarre Robocode robot, hastily created with no prior knowledge in about 16 hours for a uni tournament.

WTFIDunno by James Curran (jc27g15)

Day 1
----
WTFIDunno was born at about 23.00 on 8/12/2015.

His main advantage over other robots is his blinding colour scheme.

He has bested the mighty SpinBot, MyFirstJuniorBot, Fire and Sitting Duck many times!

He moves awkwardly and tends to obsess over targets.

WTFIDunno may or may not be some kind of subconscious reflection of his creator.

WTFIDunno is currently a MicroBot.

Day 2
----
WTFIDunno is less obsessive but still awkward.

He can now beat all sample robots except one...

WTFIDunno is now a MiniBot.

Working on his melee tactics; breaking everything else in the process.

Day 3
----
WTFIDunno is now a bit less predictable, with the side-effect that not even his creator understands his actions anymore.

Improved melee tactics; unbroke the other stuff.

WTFIDunno is now 33% less obsessive!

Day 4 - The Final Hours
----
WTFIDunno has come a long way these past few days, providing a welcome distraction from the Foundations revision.

Before he goes out to get completely slaughtered (and not in a fun way), James would just like to say that WTFIDunno is

the best (only) "robot" he's ever "built".

Really encouraging moment just now; WTFIDunno came 3rd in a 3-round Battle Royale against the filthiest sample bots around!

He only found one robot impossible... let's just hope he won't have to face it...

Epilogue
----
Ah, I'm so proud.

WTFIDunno reached (and lost) the final of the BO3 1v1 round, came 6th in the 9-bot Battle Royale, and came 15th

in a super-sized Battle Royale of 34 bots, including sample bots and super-smart bots by previous contestants.

Very respectable :D
